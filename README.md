Development ideas for Sixteen Colors

## Blocks
A pinterest-inspired layout to see the full thumbnail of every element in a pack/search/etc

- [x] Pull pack listing from API
- [x] Display in pinterest-like layout
- [x] Show lightbox on click
- [x] Show loading message while images load
- [ ] Make lightbox show previous and next image as thumbnail to navigate
- [ ] Show "progress" in lightbox (image in pack, rather than numbered, as f2/f4 blocks or similar)
- [ ] Make "Loading" message ANSI blocks (or something) and centered
- [ ] Show artwork details in lightbox
- [ ] Enable navigation between year/pack structure
- [ ] Implement JS front-end framework
